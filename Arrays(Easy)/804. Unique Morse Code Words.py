804. Unique Morse Code Words
International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows:

'a' maps to ".-",
'b' maps to "-...",
'c' maps to "-.-.", and so on.
For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:

[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]

Given an array of strings words where each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter.

For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-..--...", which is the concatenation of "-.-.", ".-", and "-...". We will call such a concatenation the transformation of a word.
Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

Constraints:
A) 1 <= words.length <= 100
B) 1 <= words[i].length <= 12
C) words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

Approach: Obtain morse codes for each letter in word and for each word in words , join them and store in set [EFFICIENT]
Can also store in hash table, but time  complexity degrades
